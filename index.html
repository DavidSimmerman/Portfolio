                <h3>- About -</h3>
                <p class="Justify">I am a passionate software developer who has been programming since I was 11 or 12 years old in 2012. 
                    At the time, I was very into the video game Minecraft, and my friends and I wanted to make a server.
                    We needed someone to program the plugins, so I got to work learning Java. As someone who loves
                    problem solving and puzzels, I quickly fell in love with the concept of coding.<br><br>

                    Over the next few years, I started to learn new programming languages on my own through YouTube,
                    Udemy, and any other resources I could find. I worked with HTML, CSS, Java, C++, and Python.
                    Unfortunately, I struggled to stay consistent with coding since I was busy with school and other
                    extracurricular activities.<br><br>

                    I am currently enrolled in <a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/" target="_blank">The Tech Academy</a> 
                    where I am learning to be a Software Developer. I am constantly working to learn more and 
                    improve my skills. <br><br>

                </p>

                        I have done several projects in different programming languages. Some of which were self-taught 
                        programs that I created for fun while others were for school.
