                rock into a swift water. If it could do the one, it could do the other; it inevitably did both.

                <p class="Justify">I am a passionate software developer who has been programming since I was 11 or 12 years old in 2012. 
                    At the time, I was very into the video game Minecraft, and my friends and I wanted to make a server.
                    We needed someone to program the plugins, so I got to work learning Java. As someone who loves
                    problem solving and puzzels, I quickly fell in love with the concept of coding.<br><br>

                    Over the next few years, I started to learn new programming languages on my own through YouTube,
                    Udemy, and any other resources I could find. Unfortunately, I struggled to stay consistent with coding since 
					I was busy with school and other extracurricular activities. I also gained a passion for computer hardware as well.
					I have built a couple of computers and constantly stay up to date watching news about the latest tech. I enjoy tearing
					things apart to see how they work and learning about how complex devices function.<br><br>
					
					I am a full stack developer with knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, and C++. I also have experience 
					working with the Django Framework as well as Unreal Engine 4. I also have several IT skills such as building and
					repairing computers. I am constantly working to expand my knowledge on programming and computers.<br><br>
					
                    I started a Computer Science Degree at Michigan State University, but later dropped out due to medial concerns.
					I then studied at <a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/" target="_blank">The Tech Academy</a> 
                    where I learned many of the skills I know today. On top of that, I took several Udemy courses primarily on C++ and
					game development. I am constantly working to learn more and 
                    improve my skills. <br><br>

                        I have done several projects in different programming languages. Some of which were self-taught 
                        programs that I created for fun while others were for school.

				<p class="Center">Here are some of my projects:<br>
					<ul><!-- TODO: add links to each project -->
						<li>CSharp-Live-Project-Summary, Python-Live-Project-Summary: These two repositories contain project summaries
							from live projects that I participated in during The Tech Academy. They were two-week sprints that simulated
							a real work environment.</li><br>
						<li>Snake: This project was my simple take on the classic snake game. It is just a console aplication using C++, so
							it is not graphically impressive; however it was challenging to make the project work using only text.</li><br>
						<li>TicTacToe: This project is a TicTacToe console application developed in C++. It can be played against another
							person, or against the CPU. The CPU has multiple difficulties: Easy, Medium, and Hard. </li><br>
						<li>Nature-Board-Game: I made this game for my sister's work. They wanted a simple Candy Land esque game
							that educates people on nature. After it was complete, it was added to their website.</li><br>
						<li>Checkers: This was one of my first big projects that I created in python. I started it my senior year of highschool,
							but never finished because I was so busy finishing up school. I may go back and complete it in the future.</li><br>
						<li>HTML-and-CSS-Projects, JavaScript-Projects, Python-Projects, C# and .NET Framework Projects: These repositories 
							contain several projects ranging from basic to more intermediate. They were created while working through 
							The Tech Academy boot camp courses.</li><br>
